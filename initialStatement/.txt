This is just some syntactic sugar that Go offers to shorten up code in some cases. For example, instead of writing:

length := getLength(email)
if length < 1 {
    fmt.Println("Email is invalid")
}


We can do:

if length := getLength(email); length < 1 {
    fmt.Println("Email is invalid")
}


Not only is this code a bit shorter, but it also removes length from the parent scope, which is convenient because we don't need it there - we only need access to it while checking a condition.
