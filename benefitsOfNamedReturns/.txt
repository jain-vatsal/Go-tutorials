THE BENEFITS OF NAMED RETURNS
GOOD FOR DOCUMENTATION (UNDERSTANDING)
Named return parameters are great for documenting a function. We know what the function is returning directly from its signature, no need for a comment.

Named return parameters are particularly important in longer functions with many return values.

func calculator(a, b int) (mul, div int, err error) {
    if b == 0 {
      return 0, 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
    }
    mul = a * b
    div = a / b
    return mul, div, nil
}

Which is easier to understand than:

func calculator(a, b int) (int, int, error) {
    if b == 0 {
      return 0, 0, errors.New("Can't divide by zero")
    }
    mul := a * b
    div := a / b
    return mul, div, nil
}
